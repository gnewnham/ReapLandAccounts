Lineage
Lineage statement
Data for basin boundaries have been captured by relevant State and Territory authorities from 1:10 000 to 1:250 000 scale source material. The balance of data are from Geoscience Australia's GEODATA Coast 100K which includes coastlines and State and Territory borders.

The following processing has been undertaken by the Department:
- Projected from AGD66 to GDA94 using NTV2 transformation. Minor attribute edits.
- Dissolved by BNAME (Basin name) to form 245 features. Attribute edits.
- Dissolved by DNUM (Division number) and DNAME (Division name) to form 12 features.
- Minor changes to field names
- Created a subset with the following query: DDIV_NAME = '4. Murray-Darling Drainage Division'
- Minor attribute edit to DDIV_NAME (edited to 'Murray-Darling Basin') and dropped DDIV_NUM field.
- Area_ha field added, and area in hectares calculated using Albers projection with GDA94 datum.
